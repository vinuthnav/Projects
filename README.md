Stock Price Prediction Using Python
This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using historical stock data. It applies data preprocessing, machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression and LSTM), and data visualization to analyze trends and predict future stock prices. The project uses Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and Keras to implement the solution.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the stock prices of a given company based on its historical stock data. This is accomplished by:

Collecting historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API.
Preprocessing the data by normalizing it and preparing it for machine learning models.
Using Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict future stock prices.
Evaluating the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and comparing the predictions to actual values.
Visualizing the predictions and actual prices using matplotlib.
Technologies Used
Python
pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy – for numerical computations
matplotlib – for data visualization
scikit-learn – for machine learning models (Linear Regression)
Keras – for deep learning (LSTM model)
yfinance – to fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance
Key Features
Data Collection: Fetches historical stock data for any stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) from Yahoo Finance.
Data Preprocessing: The stock data is cleaned, scaled, and split into training and testing datasets.
Linear Regression Model: Trains a basic linear regression model to predict the next day's closing price based on the previous 60 days.
LSTM Model: Implements a more advanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices and capture time-series patterns.
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure prediction accuracy.
Visualization: Plots actual vs predicted stock prices to visually analyze the model’s performance.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the code, you'll need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x
pip (for package management)
Installing Dependencies
Clone this repository to your local machine and install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Here’s the list of required dependencies:

yfinance
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
keras
matplotlib
Running the Project
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python file of your choice (e.g., stock_price_prediction.ipynb).
Run the code cells or the Python script. The code will:
Download stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Train a Linear Regression model and an LSTM model.
Output the Mean Squared Error for both models.
Display a plot comparing the predicted stock prices with the actual stock prices.
Example:
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import yfinance as yf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

# Fetch stock data for a specific ticker (e.g., AAPL)
ticker = "AAPL"
data = yf.download(ticker, start="2018-01-01", end="2023-01-01")
Results
The stock price prediction model is evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE). The plot generated will show the predicted prices in red and the actual prices in blue.

Example Output:
Linear Regression MSE: 0.0012
LSTM Model MSE: 0.0009
The LSTM model typically provides better predictions due to its ability to capture time-series dependencies, making it more suitable for stock price forecasting.

Future Improvements
More advanced models: Experiment with other machine learning models such as Random Forests or XGBoost for potentially better results.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models to improve accuracy.
Include more features: Add other features such as technical indicators (moving averages, RSI) or external factors (economic data) to improve predictions.
